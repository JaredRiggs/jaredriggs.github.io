      <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I am creating this website so I may have a proper platform to show my skills
        and make additions to while I continue learning new things. I have included such things
        as listing my abilities as well as providing examples. A short biography about me
        so you can have a better understanding of who I am as a person. I am also including
        a contact page and there you will find multiple ways to get in touch so we can further
        discuss any questions or concerns you may have.
